                    this was my first solo game, i made it over the course of<br>
                    two weeks. i used godot to make the game it, i chose godot<br>
                    because its an incredibly strong and easy to pickup engine<br>
                    esspecially for me as i already have alot of experience in <br>
                    writing python code. the game has a wide<br>
                    range of mechanics from the basic shooting all the up to<br>
                    an advanced roguelike system with diffrent raritys and<br>
                    chances, i coded all of these systems by myself without any<br>
                    assistance from a tutorial<br>
